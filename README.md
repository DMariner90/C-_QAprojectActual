# C-_TDP
Why are we doing this? 
This code has been created to make an application that can display and draw data from MySQL . The application has the following functions: 
It allows the user to select an option from a menu. The menu then presents the user with further options;
One option for the user is to add a new product, automatically incrementing the sale ID number and the date; 
It allows the user to filter the records from the console depending on which option they choose; 
The user has four options available and each will present different information within the console; 
Once the user is finished they can close and exit the console;

How I expected the challenge to go?
I expected that I would enjoy the project and find it a challenge with little c# experience. 
I expected some difficulty in creating the menus, however I was able to overcome the obstacles I was presented with. 

What went well? 
The syntax that adds or filters information from the c# console to the MySQL table. 
I was able to figure out the syntax and add it to the c# logic easily. 

What didn’t go as planned? 
Creating some of the methods within c#. I understood the logic but some of the built in methods I wasn’t aware of, with some research I found these and was able to implement them into my code.

Possible improvement for the future I feel that my code could be cleaned up further. Such as improving the logic behind the functions. Perhaps making one private function and then the other functions as public which use the private function. Reducing the amount of code needed to ensure the functions still work. The design and layout of the results within the console could be improved and be presented to be more user friendly.
